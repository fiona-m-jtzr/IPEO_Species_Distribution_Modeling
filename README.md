# IPEO_Species_Distribution_Modeling
Species distribution modeling with a multimodal approach including climate data, Landsat timeseries and satellite imagery.
The files included in the folder Models should be run in Google Colab and the base_path variable/the current working directory need to be adapted.
The inference.ipynb notebook in the Test folder imports the model weights for the second multimodal approach and generates predictions for the first sample in the test set. The environment requirements to run this file are specified in environment.yml file.
A folder named data containing all the training and test data for the three modalities should be imported in the Project folder.
